# Apple Touch Icon (180x180)
# To generate this properly, you need to:
# 1. Open the icon.svg file in a design tool (Figma, Adobe Illustrator, or Inkscape)
# 2. Export as PNG at 180x180px
# 3. Save as apple-touch-icon.png

# Alternative: Use an online converter like https://convertio.co/svg-png/
# Or use this command if you have ImageMagick installed:
# convert -background none -resize 180x180 icon.svg apple-touch-icon.png

# For now, you can use the icon.svg as a placeholder in modern browsers
