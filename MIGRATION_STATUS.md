# Migration Status

## ✅ Code is Ready
All code changes have been made and the app will load correctly.

## ⚠️ You Need to Run the Migration

The ban system won't work until you run the SQL migration.

### Quick Check - Is Migration Done?

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check if columns exist
SELECT column_name
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'user_profiles'
AND column_name IN ('blocked_by_admin', 'blocked_at', 'blocked_until', 'block_reason');

-- Check if banned_emails table exists
SELECT EXISTS (
  SELECT FROM information_schema.tables
  WHERE table_name = 'banned_emails'
);
```

### If Results Show Nothing → Run the Migration

Open [RUN_THIS_MIGRATION.md](RUN_THIS_MIGRATION.md) and copy the SQL to Supabase.

### Current Status:

- ✅ **App loads correctly** (with or without migration)
- ✅ **User block/unblock works** (messages page)
- ⚠️ **Admin ban system** (needs migration to work)
- ⚠️ **Signup ban check** (needs migration to work)
- ⚠️ **Login prevention** (needs migration to work)

### After Running Migration:

Everything will work perfectly! The code has error handling so it won't break if migration isn't done yet.
